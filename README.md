## ChatGPT Toolbox

User-Friendly Web Interface for ChatGPT.

I'm using chatGPT itself to write this application. For example, 90% of the code on the `/chat` page was written by chatGPT.

## What's the difference?

What is the difference between Toolbox and other ChatGPT UIs?

ChatGPT Toolbox does not have any backend service. 

You will use your own API key to directly call OpenAI's service from your browser.

You can create any tool by appending the prompt to the URL and sharing it with anyone.

## Pages

* [index](https://chatgpt.yubolun.com/) Using chatGPT as a tool.
* [tool](https://chatgpt.yubolun.com/tool/you%20are%20a%20translator) Share your tool settings via url
* [chat](https://chatgpt.yubolun.com/chat) Have a conversation with ChatGPT, just like on the official site.

## Features

- [x] /tool/[system direction] `/tool/you are a translator`
- [x] openai streaming
- [x] markdown support
- [x] code highlight & copy to clipboard
- [x] responsive design
- [x] conversation mode `/chat`

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
