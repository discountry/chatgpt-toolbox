## ChatGPT Toolbox

User-Friendly Web Interface for ChatGPT.

I'm using chatGPT itself to write this application. For example, 90% of the code on the `/chat` page was written by chatGPT.

## Pages

* [index](https://chatgpt.yubolun.com/) Using chatGPT as a tool.
* [tool](https://chatgpt.yubolun.com/tool/you%20are%20a%20translator) Share your tool settings via url
* [chat](https://chatgpt.yubolun.com/chat) Have a conversation with ChatGPT, just like on the official site.

## Features

- [x] /tool/[system direction] `/tool/you are a translator`
- [x] openai streaming
- [x] markdown support
- [x] code highlight & copy to clipboard
- [x] responsive design
- [x] conversation mode `/chat`

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
